In this week's assignment, you will need to create your own JSON document to store information about yourself and the grades you've received from week 1 to week 4 and the week 6 quiz.  That is, everything you should have received a grade for.  Then you'll need to show me you know how to navigate the JSON in that file.\n",

The `personal_information` section will hold details about me including  my name, email, year of birth, and position within my family. The `family_information` section will capture my family details, such as the names of my parents, the total number of family members, and specific information about immediate siblings, represented as a list of dictionaries, each containing a sibling's name and their position in the order of birth.
