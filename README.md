# U.S. Hospital Quality & Resource Dashboard (CMS 2025)

## Project Overview
During fall break, I had the idea to explore U.S. healthcare data and built an interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing hospital quality, ownership, emergency service availability, and birthing-friendly designations using CMS open data.

This project allowed me to uncover national hospital trends and turn raw data into actionable insights.



## Tech Stack
- **Python** – Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- **Tableau** – Interactive visualizations and dashboards  
- **CMS Open Data** – Hospital quality and service datasets  



##  Key Insights
- Over 82% of U.S. hospitals provide emergency services
- Nonprofit hospitals have the highest quality ratings  
- Maternal health trends highlighted via birthing-friendly hospitals  
- Geographic distribution and ownership patterns reveal national healthcare trends
