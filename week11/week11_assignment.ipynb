By analyzing this data, companies can identify challenges faced by workers during the pandemic, such as remote work struggles, job insecurity, and burnout. This insight can inform future workforce strategies, improve employee support programs, and shape policies around remote or hybrid work models. Ultimately, i think this project would enable organizations to create more resilient and employee-friendly work environments, ensuring better engagement, retention, and overall well-being in the post-pandemic era.\n"
