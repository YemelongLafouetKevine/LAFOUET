This data integration allows public health agencies to identify and address high-risk groups where smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity intersect, which can improve the effectiveness of campaigns promoting smoking cessation, active lifestyles, and healthy eating. Additionally, it enables healthcare providers to personalize patient education by highlighting the compounded risks of smoking and poor dietary choices, particularly in populations where these behaviors are prevalent. Ultimately, these insights support a holistic approach to reducing preventable health issues, improving population health, and optimizing the allocation of healthcare resources.\n",
